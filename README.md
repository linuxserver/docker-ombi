# PSA: Changes are happening

From August 2018 onwards, Linuxserver are in the midst of switching to a new CI platform which will enable us to build and release multiple architectures under a single repo. To this end, existing images for `arm64` and `armhf` builds are being deprecated. They are replaced by a manifest file in each container which automatically pulls the correct image for your architecture. You'll also be able to pull based on a specific architecture tag.

TLDR: Multi-arch support is changing from multiple repos to one repo per container image.

[Ombi](https://ombi.io) allows you to host your own Plex Request and user management system.
If you are sharing your Plex server with other users, allow them to request new content using an easy to manage interface!
Manage all your requests for Movies and TV with ease, leave notes for the user and get notification when a user requests something.
Allow your users to post issues against their requests so you know there is a problem with the audio etc.
Even automatically send them weekly newsletters of new content that has been added to your Plex server!

## Supported Architectures

Our images support multiple architectures such as `x86-64`, `arm64` and `armhf`. We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker [here](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md#manifest-list). 

The architectures supported by this image are:

| Architecture | Tag |
| :----: | --- |
| x86-64 | amd64-latest |
| arm64 | arm64v8-latest |
| armhf | arm32v6-latest |

## Usage

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

### docker

```
docker create \
  --name=ombi \
  -e PUID=1001 \
  -e PGID=1001 \
  -e TZ=Europe/London \
  -p 3579:3579 \
  -v </path/to/appdata/config>:/config \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  linuxserver/ombi
```

Using tags, you can choose between various versions of ombi. No tag is required to remain on the latest stable release.  
Add one of the tags, if required, to the `linuxserver/ombi` line of the run/create command in the following format, `linuxserver/ombi:development`  
The development tag will be the latest commit in the `develop` branch of ombi.  
HOWEVER, USE THE DEVELOPMENT BRANCH AT YOUR OWN PERIL !!!!!!!!!


### docker-compose

Compatible with docker-compose v2 schemas.

```
---
version: "2"
services:
  ombi:
    image: linuxserver/ombi
    container_name: ombi
    environment:
      - PUID=1001
      - PGID=1001
      - TZ=Europe/London
    volumes:
      - </path/to/appdata/config>:/config
    ports:
      - 3579:3579
    mem_limit: 4096m
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-p 3579` | web gui |
| `-e PUID=1001` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1001` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `-e TZ=Europe/London` | Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London |
| `-v /config` | Contains all relevant configuration files. |

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1001` and `PGID=1001`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id username
    uid=1001(dockeruser) gid=1001(dockergroup) groups=1001(dockergroup)
```

## Application Setup

Access the webui at `<your-ip>:3579`. Follow the setup wizard on initial install.  Then configure the required services.
